Gather Resources – Script Overview

Features:
Immersive Gathering: Players harvest resources from world props (plants, logs, rocks, dumpsters) at set locations using the correct tools and a minigame.

Dynamic Props: Props spawn randomly in zones, disappear when harvested, and respawn after a cooldown.

Tool & Minigame Integration: Activities require specific tools (axe, pickaxe, crowbar) and a skill minigame for success.

Recycling Center: Players can recycle scavenged items, with an optional “batch” mode for double-or-nothing rewards.

Configurable Blips: Map blips for all zones and recycling, easily toggled in config.

How It Works:
Find a zone and interact with a prop.
Complete the minigame and harvest with animation and effects.
Receive items in your inventory.
Recycle scavenged items for refined materials.

Configurable:
All locations, props, rewards, effects, and blips are easily adjustable in the config.
